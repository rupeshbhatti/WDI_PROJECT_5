# Planning


## Functionality

### MVP

* An intelligent medical symptom checker app. Online checkup that means you avoid waiting weeks to see a GP for initial triage
* Patient counter (visits)
* Terms of service / disclaimer
* Statement on data being safe and anonymous - patient confidentiality
* Rate the service and provide comments on how to improve

### Plus features

* Website to ask you spoken questions via voice rather than written word
* Login to save your checkup results for sharing with your GP - can it be sent to your GP? Or just download to your phone to show your GP?
* Login/register via email address
* Login with Facebook
* Login with Twitter
* Show as you type suggestions for symptom search
* Make an appointment with your GP? - ideally via the website, but a phone call to your GP would work too
* SMS reminders of appointment
* Find local health institutions in your area for follow-up: filter a map to show pharmacies / hospitals / walk-in centres
* Video conference with an actual GP for medical validation of diagnosis


## APIs to be used

* Infermedica API - have requested access. Needs to be granted in order to use it
* DialogFlow API for chatbot AI?? Do I even need to use this?
* Conversational User Interface: TalkJS API for the Conversational User Interface
* Further information on the diagnosis: 
* Google Places API for plotting hospitals / gp walk-in centres on a map?
